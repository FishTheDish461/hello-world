learning to code
Hi
I am new to the world of coding.
I am an Air force veteran, and had 2 deployments to afghanistan.
I currently work as a truck driver.
My current goals are to learn coding so i can start creating my own projects.
Hopefully i will at somepoint be able to create a product for others to consume.
